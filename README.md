# song_sentiment_analysis
This program takes input of song lyrics and classifies the song as happy, relaxed, sad, or angry by two methods.  The first method is a Naive-Bayes classifier on a Bag-Of-Words model from the song lyrics.  The results are evaluated by precision and accuracy from the resulting confusion matrix for the four classes.  The other method used to classify a song from its lyrics is a Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis.  Four lexicons are hand-built from synonyms of the respective class words as seed words.  Additional seed words were added to a few classes in order to even out the counts of the synonyms for the four classes.  Point-wise Mutual Information was used to compare the similarity (1 is exact match, i.e. conscientious &amp; respectable, -1 is two opposite words, i.e. day &amp; night) each word in a song's lyrics to each synonym word in each class lexicon.
